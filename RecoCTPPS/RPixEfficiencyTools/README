RPixEfficiency

Author: Andrea Bellora

This tool produces some useful plots to quickly check PPS Tracking Efficiency.
Download it from https://github.com/AndreaBellora/cmssw/tree/CMSSW_10_2_2_RPixEfficiency_dev

WARNING
CMS voms certificate and access to the ctpps eos directory is required to run the tool

From RPixEfficiencyTools do:



From the directory you want to create the CMSSW environment in do:

cmsrel CMSSW_10_2_2 
cd src
cmsenv
git cms-merge-topic AndreaBellora:CMSSW_10_2_2_RPixEfficiency_dev
scram b
cd RecoCTPPS/RPixEfficiencyTools
voms-proxy-init -voms cms -rfc -out x509up_u93252
./setup.sh <run_number>
./submitReReco.sh <run_number>

Wait until the job is finished (it can take several hours..).
Check with bjobs (to have a "real time check use" watch bjobs)

./submitEfficiencyAnalysis <run_number>

Wait until the job is finished (this is shorter, but can still take more than one hour).

root -l 'ViewPlots.C(<run_number
This produces the efficiency plots. Check that the results are ok (i.e. not that the detector is performing well, but that there hasn't been any error in the analysis).

If everything is ok run: ./cleanAndSave <run_number>

Every job is set to send an email to the user once it's finished. The email should report that the job is "DONE" and not "EXITED". If this isn't the case, check in its logfiles and errorfiles the error that caused the job to fail. If it's due to problems while getting files from the server, just resubmit the job with its ./submit script.
